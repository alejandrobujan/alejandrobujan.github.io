        <article>
            <p>First and foremost, my name is Alejandro Buján, a CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) student and I like what I do.</p>
            <p>I am currently into a Research Collaboration Grant in the <a href="https://lbd.udc.es/MainPage.do?lang=en_US">Databases Lab. Research Group</a> of the Department of Computer Science, University of A Coruña, where I am delving into aspects such as Software Product Line (SPL) engineering, version control systems and code generation based on Model-Driven Development.</p>
            <p>I feel comfortable in international contexts, since I have studied part of my degree at <a href="https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/">Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea</a>, I have completed a stay at the <a href="https://www.learnovatecentre.org/">Learnovate Research Centre, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland</a>, as well as internships in companies in Turin, Italy and Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
            <p>I also won a few national and regional academic awards during my years as a CSE student:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, Goverment of Spain (2019). <b>National Bronze Medal in IT - Network Computer Systems Administration</b>.</li>
                    <li>Regional Ministry of Culture, Education, Vocational Training and Universities, Regional Government of Galicia (2018). <b>Regional Gold Medal in Network Computer Systems Administration</b>.</li>
                </ul>
